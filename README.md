# ovdb

`ovdb` is the OpenVaultDB command-line interface — the canonical
developer/admin tool for creating, running, and operating an OpenVaultDB
instance: user-owned, portable databases with pluggable storage engines
(SQLite, inGitDB, ...).

The reference implementation and Go libraries backing this CLI live at
[`github.com/openvaultdb/openvaultdb-go`](https://github.com/openvaultdb/openvaultdb-go).

## Install

Via Homebrew (macOS/Linux):

```sh
brew install --cask openvaultdb/tap/ovdb
```

Via `go install` (requires a Go toolchain):

```sh
go install github.com/openvaultdb/ovdb@latest
```

## Usage

```sh
ovdb --help
```

- **`ovdb init`** — create a database manifest (`--id`, `--engine`,
  `--schema-mode`, `--path`, `--out`).
- **`ovdb serve`** — run the OpenVaultDB HTTP API server over the manifests
  in `--dir` and/or listed with `--manifest`. With `--data-dir`, new
  databases can also be created at runtime.
- **`ovdb status`** — show the status of a running `ovdb serve` instance.
- **`ovdb databases`** — list, and (`databases create`) create, databases on
  a running server.
- **`ovdb token`** — manage revocable, scoped API tokens against a running
  server (create, list, revoke).
- **`ovdb cloud`** — sign in to OpenVaultDB Cloud through a browser, inspect
  the current login, revoke it, or list safe database registration metadata
  (`login`, `status`, `logout`, `databases`). Credentials use the operating
  system keyring by default. Plaintext storage requires the explicit
  `--insecure-storage` flag.
- **`ovdb self-update`** — check for or install a newer CLI release (alias:
  `ovdb update`). Homebrew-managed installs confirm, then run
  `brew upgrade --cask ovdb` directly without a shell; manual installs are
  checksum-verified and replaced atomically. `--yes` skips confirmation,
  `--dry-run` shows the exact action without executing it, and `--version`
  pins are supported only for manual installs because Homebrew does not
  guarantee arbitrary historical cask releases.

```sh
ovdb self-update --check
ovdb self-update --check --format json
ovdb self-update
ovdb self-update --yes
ovdb self-update --dry-run
# Manual installs only:
ovdb self-update --version v0.3.0 # github.com/openvaultdb/ovdb release
```

### Cloud database catalogue

`ovdb cloud databases list` (or `ls`) lists registrations in every accessible
Space. Use `--space personal` for the personal Space, `--space <id>` for one
Space, and `--json` for machine-readable data. `ovdb cloud databases get <id>`
shows one registration. These commands need the explicit `databases:read`
scope, which grants registration metadata only—not records or credentials. If
you signed in before this scope was requested, run `ovdb cloud login` again.

Run `ovdb <command> --help` for the full flag reference of any subcommand,
or `ovdb version` for build version/commit/date.

## Development

```sh
go build -o ovdb .
go test ./...
```
